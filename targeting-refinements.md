# Facebook Ad Targeting Refinements for IT Consultants

## Targeting Evolution

### Initial Campaign Targeting (First 48 Hours)
- **Age Range**: 30-64
- **Geography**: Nationwide
- **Minimal Additional Parameters**: Broad targeting to establish baseline performance

### Refined Targeting (Implemented March 8, 2025)
Added specific parameters to better reach independent IT consultants:

1. **Professional Roles**:
   - Business Decision Makers
   - IT Decision Makers
   - Independent Contractor

2. **Industry Focus**:
   - IT and Technical Services

3. **Work Arrangements**:
   - Small Business Owners
   - Freelance Web Designers/Developers

## Targeting Strategy Rationale

### Problem Identification
Initial campaign data showed:
- Reasonable click-through rates (1.17% overall)
- Clicks not translating to landing page conversions
- Leads generated not matching the intended IT consultant profile

### Solution Approach
- **Multi-dimensional Targeting**: Combining industry, role, and work arrangement parameters
- **Balanced Restrictions**: Refining audience without overly limiting delivery
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Providing Facebook with better starting parameters while still allowing learning

## Facebook Targeting Mechanics

### Understanding Detailed Targeting
- **Multiple Criteria Relationship**: Parameters added in detailed targeting section function as "OR" conditions (expanding audience)
- **Audience Size Considerations**: Maintained sufficient audience size for algorithm optimization
- **Combined with Creative Elements**: Updated CTA to "Apply Now" to better align with refined audience

## Expected Impact

### Performance Metrics to Monitor
- **CTR Improvement**: Expecting improved click-through rate with more relevant audience
- **Audience Quality**: Looking for better match between landing page visitors and target audience
- **Conversion Metrics**: Anticipating improved quality of leads generated

### Next Steps in Targeting Evolution
1. **Analysis Period**: Allow 3-5 days to evaluate impact of targeting refinements
2. **Lookalike Development**: Once quality conversions occur, develop lookalike audiences
3. **Geographic Consideration**: Potentially test tech hub targeting in future iterations
4. **Interest Expansion**: Consider adding technology-specific interests if initial refinements show promise

## Implementation Notes

### Targeting Parameter Selection
- Focused on parameters most closely aligned with independent IT consultants
- Selected overlapping parameters to create a comprehensive filter
- Avoided overly specific parameters that might restrict delivery

### Maintaining Testing Integrity
- Applied refined targeting only to new campaign variation
- Kept original campaigns unchanged for performance comparison
- Combined targeting refinement with CTA change for comprehensive optimization test
