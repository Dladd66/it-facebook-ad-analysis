#### Campaign Performance Breakdown:

   - 14 unique link clicks
   - 1.35% CTR
   - $6.54 CPC
   - 1,038 impressions
   - Best performing overall

2. **Second Best Campaign**: 
   - 11 unique link clicks
   - 1.23% CTR
   - $7.32 CPC
   - 1,059 impressions
   - Strong performer, very close to top campaign

3. **New Campaign with Combined Changes (48-hour test)**: 
   - 0 clicks
   - 0.00% CTR
   - No CPC (no clicks)
   - 511 impressions
   - Combined refined targeting + "Apply Now" CTA failed to generate any clicks

4. **Previously Paused Underperformer**: 
   - 3 unique link clicks
   - 0.87% CTR
   - $11.60 CPC
   - 345 impressions
   - Confirmed as lowest performer

### Key Learnings
1. **Combined changes produced negative results**: The attempt to simultaneously refine targeting AND change the CTA button to "Apply Now" resulted in zero clicks despite substantial impressions.

2. **Testing hypothesis**: Either the refined targeting parameters were too restrictive, the "Apply Now" CTA created too much friction, or the combination of both changes negatively impacted performance.

3. **Top campaigns showing consistent performance**: Both original campaigns continue to perform well with CTRs above industry averages.

### New Optimization Actions

#### 1. Pause Failed Combined Test
- **Paused Campaign**: New campaign with combined targeting + CTA changes (0.00% CTR)
- **Analysis**: Combined changes approach did not work - need to test variables individually

#### 2. Create New Single-Variable Test
- **New Test Approach**: Create variation of top-performing campaign with ONLY targeting changes
- **Variable Isolation**: Keep everything identical to top performer (copy, image, CTA) but apply refined targeting parameters
- **Targeting Parameters Used**:
  * Business Decision Makers
  * IT and Technical Services
  * IT Decision Makers
  * Small Business Owners
  * Freelance Web Designers/Developers
  * Independent Contractor
- **Advantage Detailed Targeting**: OFF (maintaining tight control over audience definition)

#### 3. Campaign Structure
- **Budget Allocation**: $15/day for each active campaign (maintaining $45/day total budget)
- **Campaign Naming**: Clear labeling to track variations
  * "BRV - IT Consultants - Original Top (1.35% CTR)"
  * "BRV - IT Consultants - Second Best (1.23% CTR)"
  * "BRV - IT Consultants - Targeting Test"

### Testing Rationale
1. **Single-variable testing**: After seeing poor results from combined changes, switching to methodical single-variable approach
2. **Focus on targeting first**: Testing whether refined targeting alone impacts performance
3. **Maintaining control campaigns**: Keeping successful campaigns running while testing new variations

### Next Steps
1. **Monitor single-variable test** for 48-72 hours
2. **Compare performance metrics** between original campaigns and new targeting test
3. **Depending on results**, potentially test CTA change as next single-variable test
4. **Continue investigating** tracking discrepancies between Facebook and website analytics
