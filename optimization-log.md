## March 14, 2025: Shifting Focus to Lead Quality

### Latest Campaign Changes
- **Applied Refined Targeting to Best Performer**:
  - Modified "BYOB Campaign #6" (previously best performing with 1.29% CTR) 
  - Applied the same refined targeting parameters used in newer test variant
  - Maintained all creative elements and ad copy
  - Campaign structure now allows better comparison of targeting impact

### Performance Analysis (48-Hour Data on Newer Targeting Test)
- **Current Lead Generation Performance**:
  1. **Original Top Campaign**: 5 leads at $24.75 cost per lead (now modified with refined targeting)
  2. **Copy Variant**: 5 leads at $25.12 cost per lead (maintained original targeting)
  3. **Targeting Test**: 1 lead at $29.29 cost per lead (using refined targeting)

- **CTR Comparison**:
  1. **Original Top Campaign**: 1.29% CTR (now modified)
  2. **Copy Variant**: 1.25% CTR (unchanged)
  3. **Targeting Test**: 0.52% CTR (refined targeting only)

### Key Issue Identified
Analysis of lead behavior revealed:
- Leads from broadly targeted campaigns are not completing the high-intent survey
- This strongly suggests these leads are not qualified IT consultants
- Focus needs to shift from maximizing CTR to improving lead quality

### Strategic Pivot
- **Moving from quantity to quality**: Accepting potentially lower CTR in exchange for more qualified leads
- **Success metric shift**: Primary focus now on high-intent survey completions rather than CTR or lead volume
- **Testing approach**: Running similar creative with different targeting approaches to isolate impact

## March 11, 2025: 96-Hour Performance Analysis & New Test Implementation

### Latest Performance Analysis (96-hour data)
- **Total Link Clicks**: 28
- **Total Impressions**: 2,953
- **Overall CTR**: 1.02%
- **Total Spend**: $258.17
- **Average CPC**: $8.61

#### Campaign Performance Breakdown:
1. **Top Performing Campaign**: 
   - 14 unique link clicks
   - 1.35% CTR
   - $6.54 CPC
   - 1,038 impressions
   - Best performing overall

2. **Second Best Campaign**: 
   - 11 unique link clicks
   - 1.23% CTR
   - $7.32 CPC
   - 1,059 impressions
   - Strong performer, very close to top campaign

3. **New Campaign with Combined Changes (48-hour test)**: 
   - 0 clicks
   - 0.00% CTR
   - No CPC (no clicks)
   - 511 impressions
   - Combined refined targeting + "Apply Now" CTA failed to generate any clicks

4. **Previously Paused Underperformer**: 
   - 3 unique link clicks
   - 0.87% CTR
   - $11.60 CPC
   - 345 impressions
   - Confirmed as lowest performer

### Key Learnings
1. **Combined changes produced negative results**: The attempt to simultaneously refine targeting AND change the CTA button to "Apply Now" resulted in zero clicks despite substantial impressions.

2. **Testing hypothesis**: Either the refined targeting parameters were too restrictive, the "Apply Now" CTA created too much friction, or the combination of both changes negatively impacted performance.

3. **Top campaigns showing consistent performance**: Both original campaigns continue to perform well with CTRs above industry averages.

### New Optimization Actions

#### 1. Pause Failed Combined Test
- **Paused Campaign**: New campaign with combined targeting + CTA changes (0.00% CTR)
- **Analysis**: Combined changes approach did not work - need to test variables individually

#### 2. Create New Single-Variable Test
- **New Test Approach**: Create variation of top-performing campaign with ONLY targeting changes
- **Variable Isolation**: Keep everything identical to top performer (copy, image, CTA) but apply refined targeting parameters
- **Targeting Parameters Used**:
  * Business Decision Makers
  * IT and Technical Services
  * IT Decision Makers
  * Small Business Owners
  * Freelance Web Designers/Developers
  * Independent Contractor
- **Advantage Detailed Targeting**: OFF (maintaining tight control over audience definition)

#### 3. Campaign Structure
- **Budget Allocation**: $15/day for each active campaign (maintaining $45/day total budget)
- **Campaign Naming**: Clear labeling to track variations
  * "BRV - IT Consultants - Original Top (1.35% CTR)"
  * "BRV - IT Consultants - Second Best (1.23% CTR)"
  * "BRV - IT Consultants - Targeting Test"

### Testing Rationale
1. **Single-variable testing**: After seeing poor results from combined changes, switching to methodical single-variable approach
2. **Focus on targeting first**: Testing whether refined targeting alone impacts performance
3. **Maintaining control campaigns**: Keeping successful campaigns running while testing new variations
