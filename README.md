## Latest Optimization Strategy (March 11, 2025)

### Single-Variable Testing Approach
After discovering that combined changes produced negative results, we've shifted to a more methodical single-variable testing approach:

1. **New Test Implementation**:
   - Created variation of top-performing campaign
   - Testing ONLY refined targeting parameters
   - Keeping all other elements identical (creative, copy, CTA)
   - Advantage Detailed Targeting: OFF

2. **Targeting Parameters Being Tested**:
   - Business Decision Makers
   - IT and Technical Services
   - IT Decision Makers
   - Small Business Owners
   - Freelance Web Designers/Developers
   - Independent Contractor

3. **Hypothesis**:
   - Testing whether refined targeting alone will improve or reduce performance
   - Isolating impact of targeting from CTA change in previous failed test

## Key Learnings & Insights

### Testing Methodology
- **Combined changes can mask individual effects**: When multiple variables change simultaneously, it's impossible to determine which change impacted performance
- **Single-variable approach required**: Testing one element at a time provides clearer insights

### Audience Targeting
- **Original broad targeting performing well**: The initial minimal targeting approach has delivered strong CTRs
- **Refined targeting needs isolated testing**: The impact of more specific targeting parameters needs to be evaluated independently

### Creative Performance
- **Mathematical wall breakthrough image continues to perform best**: Visually representing breaking free from constraints resonates with audience
- **CTAs may have significant impact**: The failed test suggests "Apply Now" may create too much friction compared to "Learn More"

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring original campaigns and new single-variable test
- Plan follow-up test of CTA change alone (pending results of targeting test)
- Address ongoing tracking discrepancies between Facebook and website analytics
- Consider landing page optimizations to improve post-click experience
