## Campaign Performance Summary

### Active Campaigns Analysis
1. **Previous Top Performer (Now Modified)**: 
   - Originally: 1.29% CTR, $24.75 cost per lead, 5 leads
   - Now modified with refined targeting parameters
   - Performance is being monitored

2. **Copy Variant (Unchanged)**:

   - Serves as control for comparison

3. **Targeting Test (Recent Addition)**:

   - Using refined targeting parameters
   - Lower CTR but potential for higher-quality leads

### Key Issue Identified
- High CTR ads with broad targeting are generating leads, but none are completing the high-intent survey
- This suggests leads may be interested in the concept but don't actually qualify
- Focus has shifted from maximizing CTR to improving lead quality

## Latest Optimization Strategy (March 14, 2025)

### Quality Over Quantity Approach
We've identified that our higher CTR campaigns with broader targeting were not producing qualified leads who complete the high-intent survey. In response, we've:

1. **Applied Refined Targeting to Best Performer**:
   - Took our best-performing campaign (Campaign #6)
   - Applied the same refined targeting parameters used in our newer test
   - Maintaining all creative elements that were working well

2. **Maintaining Campaign Diversity**:
   - Keeping the "Copy" variant with original broad targeting as a control
   - Running two variations with refined targeting (modified best performer and newer test)
   - This structure allows for better isolation of targeting impact

3. **Targeting Parameters Being Used**:
   - Business Decision Makers
   - IT and Technical Services
   - IT Decision Makers
   - Small Business Owners
   - Freelance Web Designers/Developers
   - Independent Contractor

4. **Shift in Success Metrics**:
   - Primary focus on high-intent survey completions rather than CTR
   - Willing to accept lower CTR if lead quality improves
   - Monitoring conversions more closely than click metrics

## Key Learnings & Insights

### Audience Quality vs. Quantity
- **CTR is not the primary success metric**: Higher CTR with unqualified leads is less valuable than lower CTR with qualified leads
- **Pre-qualification matters**: May need clearer qualification criteria in ad copy
- **Facebook algorithm optimization**: Narrower targeting may require longer optimization period

### Testing Methodology
- **Single-variable approach continues**: Now comparing same ad with different targeting approaches
- **Better isolation of variables**: Can more clearly determine targeting impact

### Next Steps
- Monitor performance of best ad now with refined targeting
- Evaluate high-intent survey completion rates across campaigns
- Consider adding more explicit qualification language to ad copy
- Analyze landing page performance for different traffic sources
