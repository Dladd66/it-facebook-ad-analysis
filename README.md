   - Visualizes concept of protected growth
   - Clear but less emotionally resonant with audience

   - More literal representation of target audience
   - Lacks distinctive concept visualization

## 48-Hour Optimization Strategy
Based on our 36-hour data, we're implementing the following optimization at the 48-hour mark:

1. **Cut the Underperformer**:
   - Remove Campaign #5-C (Professional Laptop Image - 0.47% CTR)
   - Maintain the $15/day budget allocation from this campaign

2. **Double Down on the Winner**:
   - Create a duplicate of the winning campaign (Math Wall Image - 1.87% CTR)
   - Modify CTA from "Learn More" to "Apply Now" on new variation
   - Maintain same targeting, budget, copy and image

3. **Maintain Control**:
   - Keep the middle-performing campaign (Tree Image - 0.56% CTR) as a control
   - Maintain its $15/day budget allocation

4. **Budget Allocation**:
   - $15/day: Original Math Wall campaign (unchanged)
   - $15/day: New Math Wall campaign with "Apply Now" CTA
   - $15/day: Tree Protection campaign (control)
   - Total daily budget remains $45/day
