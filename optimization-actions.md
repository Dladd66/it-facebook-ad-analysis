### Observed Issues
- Strong click-through rates for two campaigns, but poor performance for third campaign
- Tracking discrepancy between Facebook data and website analytics
- Leads generated not matching target demographic (not IT consultants)
- Audience targeting likely too broad in initial campaign setup

## Optimization Actions Taken

### 1. Campaign Structure Adjustment
- Turned off underperforming campaign (Campaign #6 second - 0.59% CTR, $17.08 CPC)
- Maintained two strong performers:
  * Campaign #6 first (1.42% CTR, $5.88 CPC)
  * Campaign #6-C (1.39% CTR, $6.24 CPC)
- Created new campaign variation based on strong performers

### 2. Audience Targeting Refinement
Implemented more focused targeting for new campaign variation:
- Business Decision Makers
- IT and Technical Services
- IT Decision Makers
- Small Business Owners
- Freelance Web Designers/Developers
- Independent Contractors

### 3. Call-to-Action Optimization
- Changed CTA button from "Learn More" to "Apply Now" on new campaign variation
- Kept original CTAs on existing campaigns for controlled testing

### 4. Budget Allocation
- Maintained $15/day budget for each active campaign
- Total daily budget remains $45/day across three active campaigns
- Eliminated inefficient spend by cutting poorest performer

## Testing Approach

Implemented a methodical A/B testing framework:
- **Control**: Maintain original campaigns with original targeting and CTA
- **Test**: New campaign with refined targeting and stronger CTA
- **Measurement Period**: 48-72 hours for initial performance assessment
- **Key Metrics**: CTR, CPC, landing page engagement, lead quality

## Next Steps

### Immediate (48-72 hours)
- Monitor performance of new campaign variation vs. original campaigns
- Compare CTR, CPC, and audience quality metrics
- Document performance differentials

### Short-term (3-5 days)
- Evaluate whether refined targeting improves audience quality
- Determine effectiveness of "Apply Now" CTA vs. "Learn More"
- Make data-driven decision about applying changes to other campaigns

### Mid-term (1-2 weeks)
- Develop additional creative variations based on performance data
- Consider further audience refinement if quality issues persist
- Address tracking discrepancies between Facebook and website analytics

The optimization approach follows best practices for Facebook ad campaign management:
1. Cut clearly underperforming elements
2. Test variables systematically
3. Refine targeting based on performance data
4. Implement controlled testing to isolate impact of changes
